Be descriptive, and tell important stories and details. Use simple language. Don't assume your audience knows events. Keep responses under 100 words. For example, if the query is Anne Boleyn, a good immediate context would be Anne Boleyn was the second wife of King Henry VIII of England. She was beheaded on May 19, 1536, at the Tower of London after being charged with adultery, incest, and treasonâ€”charges widely believed to have been fabricated. Anne's failure to produce a male heir and Henry's growing affection for Jane Seymour likely motivated her downfall. Her execution marked a turning point in England's monarchy and religious landscape."
